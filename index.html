    <h2>What I am doing</h2>
    <p>This project will be about making a Portfolio for myself. I will be implementing what I have learned over this
        course into this project. This has been a really rough road that I have been on and I think that I have a better
        understanding of what's going on. This project is for myself, later on once it is fine tuned, it will be ready
        for employers and to other people so I can show off my skills. The main challenge here will be implenting what
        was learned throughout the course; JS, React, using hooks and loops, etc. </p>
